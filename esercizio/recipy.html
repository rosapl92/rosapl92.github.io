<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>
    <strong><u>This recipe</u> makes quick, tasty hummus</strong>, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a <q>delicious thick paste used</q> heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with
    salad,
    grilled meats&quot and pitta &quot breads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>

        175g of tahini<br>
        6 sundried tomatoes<br>
        Half a red pepper<br>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        <mark>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</mark>
        <br>
        Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
        Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
        Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
        If you  want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
        If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
    </p>

<p>
    For a <small>different flavour</small>, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili
    pepper, lime and &apos;  &amp; Ciao  &amp;
    chipotle,
    <del>harissa and mint</del>
    , or spinach <sub>2</sub> and feta cheese. Experiment  and see what works for you.

<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>
    Refrigerate
    <ins>the finished hummus</ins>
    in a sealed container. You <sup>5</sup> should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. <cite>If it starts to become fizzy</cite>, you should definitely discard it.<br>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Hummus is suitable for freezing</blockquote>
; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
